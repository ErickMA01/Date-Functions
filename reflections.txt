Test 1

- My test_days_elapsed1 test failed and this implies that my days_elapsed function is not working as expected.

- The test_day_of_week (my_date_test.MyDateTest) test also failed. My function is returning a day that is two days behind the expected day.

- The test_to_str1 (my_date_test.MyDateTest) test is also failing. Ofcourse this is expected if the above two functions aren't working because they are connected.

- I need to figure out the bug in my code and I think I should start with the days_elapsed function.

Test 2

I found a bug in the days_elapsed function, specifically in the calculation of the days_in_year1 and days_in_year2.

After rectifying the error my program worked just fine.
